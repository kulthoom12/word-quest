# Word Quest

**Word Quest** is a fun and thrilling game designed to test your detective skills by solving mystery-themed scrambled words.

On the main screen, you can press **Start Game** to dive into the challenge, or **How to Play** to view the instructions first.

Each round gives you 60 seconds to decode a scrambled word. If you get stuck, you can use up to three hints. Type in your answer and hit **Submit** — if you're correct, you'll earn points and move on to the next clue.

It’s a fast-paced, brain-teasing game perfect for crime lovers and puzzle enthusiasts alike!

## UX

### Target Audience 

This word guess game is for anyone who enjoys a fun and easy word puzzle. It’s great for teens and adults looking to challenge their vocabulary or just have a quick, entertaining way to pass the time. You can play it on your phone, tablet, or computer, so it’s perfect for students, casual gamers, or anyone learning a new language.

### How to play

Getting started is easy! Just hit the **Start Game** button, and you’ll see a scrambled word appear. Your job is to figure out what the word is and type it in, then press **Submit** to check your answer. If you’re stuck, don’t worry—you can click the Hint button to reveal a letter, but use it wisely because you only get three hints per word. If you want to try again or start fresh, just hit the **Restart** button. Have fun guessing and see how many words you can solve before time runs out!

### Game Flow 

When you start the game, you’ll see a scrambled word on the screen. Your goal is to figure out what the word is by guessing the correct letters. If you get stuck, don’t worry — you can use **hints** to help you out. Once you think you’ve got the word, just hit **Submit**. If your answer is correct, the game moves on to the next word and the fun continues!

If you make a mistake, you can try again or hit **Restart** at any time. The game’s simple and relaxed flow makes it fun to play without any pressure.

### Typography 

For **Word Quest**, I chose two fonts that really help bring the mystery and crime theme to life.

**Primary Font – Roboto Slab**

Roboto Slab is used throughout the main parts of the game—like instructions, buttons, and gameplay text. It’s clean, easy to read, and has a slightly serious tone, which fits well with the idea of solving crimes. It reminds you a bit of old police files or typewritten reports, helping to set the scene.

**Secondary Font – Cinzel Decorative**

This one’s used for headings and titles. Cinzel Decorative has a dramatic and slightly vintage feel, which adds to the mystery. It makes you think of something secretive or hidden, like an unsolved case or a mysterious letter.

Together, these fonts help create the right mood—one that feels like you're stepping into a detective story, but still keeps everything clear and readable while playing.
