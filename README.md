# Word Quest

I created this game as a fun and thrilling way to test your detective skills by solving mystery-themed scrambled words.

On the main screen, you can press **Start Game** to dive into the challenge, or **How to Play** to read the instructions first.

Each round gives you 60 seconds to decode a word. If you get stuck, you can use up to three hints. Type in your answer and hit **Submit** — if you're right, you’ll earn points and move on to the next clue.

It’s a fast-paced, brain-teasing game perfect for crime lovers and puzzle solvers alike!

## UX

### Target Audeiance 

This word guess game is for anyone who enjoys a fun and easy word puzzle. It’s great for teens and adults looking to challenge their vocabulary or just have a quick, entertaining way to pass the time. You can play it on your phone, tablet, or computer, so it’s perfect for students, casual gamers, or anyone learning a new language.

### How to play

Getting started is easy! Just hit the Start Game button, and you’ll see a scrambled word appear. Your job is to figure out what the word is and type it in, then press Submit to check your answer. If you’re stuck, don’t worry—you can click the Hint button to reveal a letter, but use it wisely because you only get three hints per word. If you want to try again or start fresh, just hit the Restart button. Have fun guessing and see how many words you can solve before time runs out!

### Game Flow 

When you start the game, you’ll see a scrambled word on the screen. Your goal is to figure out what the word is by guessing the right letters. If you get stuck, don’t worry—you can use hints to help you out. Once you think you’ve got it, just submit your answer. If you’re right, the game moves on to the next word and the fun continues. If not, you can try again or restart whenever you want. It’s an easy, relaxed flow that makes playing enjoyable without any stress.

### Typography 

For Word Quest, I chose two fonts that really help bring the mystery and crime theme to life.

**Primary Font – Roboto Slab**

Roboto Slab is used throughout the main parts of the game—like instructions, buttons, and gameplay text. It’s clean, easy to read, and has a slightly serious tone, which fits well with the idea of solving crimes. It reminds you a bit of old police files or typewritten reports, helping to set the scene.

**Secondary Font – Cinzel Decorative**

This one’s used for headings and titles. Cinzel Decorative has a dramatic and slightly vintage feel, which adds to the mystery. It makes you think of something secretive or hidden, like an unsolved case or a mysterious letter.

Together, these fonts help create the right mood—one that feels like you're stepping into a detective story, but still keeps everything clear and readable while playing.
